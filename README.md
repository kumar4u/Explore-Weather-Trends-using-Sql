# Explore Weather Trends
The Goal of the project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live.

# Abstract
- In this project, local and global temperature data has been analyzed and the temperature trends in Bangalore, India has been compared to overall global temperature trends.
- Data extraction has been done by writing SQL queries then exported to CSV.
- MS Excel has been used to calculate moving average over decades of years in order to get the best visualized line chart comparing data of Bangalore vs. Global.

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Extract the data from the database using Udacity workspace.
- Export the temp data for the global as well as for the closest big city (Bangalore).
- write the appropriate SQL query.
- Open up the CSV in Excel.
- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.
- Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable .
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
- Answer questions such as - Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
- “How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
- What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
